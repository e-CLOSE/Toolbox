Plickers is a rapid-response classroom-polling app that lets teachers use one mobile device to scan paper cards for student responses. 

## Detailed description & quick guide

The Plickers platform has been designed with accessibility as a top priority, meaning it's perfect for the vast majority of educational settings. Students answer questions by holding up unique cards, so there's no need for student devices or accounts, and sessions can even be taken offline with no internet connection. During class, Plickers teachers display content to their students through the Now Playing feature of plickers.com. Students will provide their answers by holding up their Plickers cards and orientating them in a certain way. The Plickers mobile app is then used to scan the cards to collect student answers, and to control the session by revealing correct choices and moving through questions within a Set. When a Plickers session is complete, student reports and scoresheets are provided at plickers.com, which can be used to keep track of individual and collective performance over time. It's even possible to download results for further analysis.
