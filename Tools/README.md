# :hammer_and_wrench: Tools folder :hammer_and_wrench:

This folder is meant to keep information on each of the tools suggested
within the e-CLOSE project, under the IO2 working group.

The initial idea would be to have a single `md` file for each of the
suggested tools, and afterwards generate links to them, possibly
from within this same `README.md` file.
