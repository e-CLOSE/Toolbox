# :hammer_and_wrench: Tools folder :hammer_and_wrench:

This folder is meant to keep information on each of the tools suggested
within the e-CLOSE project, under the IO2 working group.

There is a single `md` file for each of the collected tools. Indexing is done from the [issues section](https://github.com/e-CLOSE/Toolbox/issues), and you can also access related tools by following the labels next to the titles in each tool description file.
