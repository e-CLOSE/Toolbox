It is a whiteboard animation software that allows to create professional and realistic whiteboard videos.


## Detailed description & quick guide

Doodly is a video editor, focused on the creation of short clips and animations, and particularly on doodle-based ones. Several effects are included to animate a hand drawing the animations in different places (whiteboard, crystal, etc.).

Its most basic version includes a set of assets, but additional ones could be included by users, who could only indicate the drawing path in a customized way. 

Doodles could be black and white or colour ones, the speed of the animation and different parts of the clip can be edited as in other video edition frameworks. 
Additionally, recorded voice, music, etc., could be included as well. 
Video edition follows a drag-and-drop (simple) approach.

Doodly includes continuous software updates.
