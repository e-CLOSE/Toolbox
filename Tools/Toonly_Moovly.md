Drag and drop explainer video creator that generates cartoon videos to entertain.


## Detailed description & quick guide

Following the approach of [Doodly](https://github.com/e-CLOSE/Toolbox/blob/main/Tools/Doodly.md) or [CreateStudio](https://github.com/e-CLOSE/Toolbox/blob/main/Tools/CreateStudio.md), many different video editors coexist with different functionalities. Some examples of these are Toonly and Moovly. Toonly emphasizes the use of "toons" or cartoon-like animations, while Moovly is focused on movie-like video clips (while Doodly was more focused on doodles and CreateStudio in animation).

In all cases, they all share similar foundations. Their most basic version includes a set of assets, but additional ones could be included by users.
Video edition follows a drag-and-drop (simple) approach.
