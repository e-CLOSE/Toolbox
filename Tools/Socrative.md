Interactive web-based student-response system (quizzes, polls, etc.).


## Detailed description & quick guide

Allows the generation of sets of questions to be posed to students
interactively. You create the set, with the correct answers, and then
can launch it, so that students can reply. Real time results are
easily shown and, after the quizz/poll, you can send the results
individually. You can also download the students results in an excel
file for easy further processing.

The quizz are launched in "rooms", with several possibilities (requesting
student names or doing it anonimously, competition, changing questions
and/or answer order, etc.).

The free version allows you to only have one room, and student
rosters are not supported.
