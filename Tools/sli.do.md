Online tool for live polls, Q&A, quizzes and word clouds.


## Detailed description & quick guide

Your go-to interaction app for hybrid meetings
Engage your participants with live polls, Q&A, quizzes and word clouds — whether you meet in the office, online or in-between.

+ Live Polls: 
Make your meetings and events more interactive by polling your audience in real time. Live polls are an easy way to kick-start the conversation, check knowledge or get instant feedback.

+ Live Q&A:
Let everyone in the audience ask their questions and vote for the ones they like the most. Slido will help you prioritize the discussion topics for all-hands meetings, Ask Me Anything sessions or Q&As after presentations.

+ Quizzes:
Design a fun quiz that fits your presentation, training or class theme. You can use it to break the ice, recap the content, entertain or test the attendees.

+ Analytics:
Discover what topics resonate with your audience and use it to fuel your decisions. Slido Analytics lets you view, analyze and export all the interaction data from your event.

+ Ideas:
Collect and curate the best ideas from your participants, whether you’re deciding on team projects or summarizing the key learnings from your workshop.
