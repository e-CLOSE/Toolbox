Platform for instant messaging, audio and video calls, online meetings, collaborative work, file and data sharing.


## Detailed description & quick guide

Google Meet is a video conferencing service from Google. It's a great solution for both individuals and businesses to meet on audio and video calls. It was born from Google Hangouts, but boasts some unique features.


## Additional details

- Google Meet is primarily designed as a way to host video meetings, however, you can enable the camera and microphone independently, so you can just use it for audio calls if you wish.
- You can create ad hoc calls and invite your friends and family and they can join by typing your meeting code or you can send them a link that they click on.
- One of the best things about Google Meet is that you don't need to install any software on desktop, everyone in the call (the organizer and the attendees) simply has to be using a modern web browser.
- Subscription mode: Company account (Google)
- Platform: Web, iOS, Android
- Tested by: UAH (Elisa); UA (Romeu); TUL (Gertruda)
