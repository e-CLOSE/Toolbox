Website containing of applications for creating and sharing crosswords, games, quizzes, diagrams and others.


## Detailed description & quick guide

ClassTools.net includes planty of free quizzes, games, activities and
diagrams which can be use as templates to create ones own activities.

Each template can be saved as a stand-alone HTML file or as a Widget that can be embedded into a blog or wiki - as long as it is non-commercial (commerical use is allowed via a premium subscription). However, downloaded HTML files still need to communicate with the ClassTools server and therefore require a computer to have an internet connection.

The saved templates stay on the server permanently. The only exception is for files which are not accessed even once during a 12-month period. At this point they are considered to be dormant and may be removed from the server to clear space.
