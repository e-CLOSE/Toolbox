Interactive web-based student-response system (quizzes, polls, etc.) with PowerPoint add-in or the Google Slides extension to insert Wooclap quizzes directly into presentations.

## Detailed description & quick guide

Wooclap is designed for teachers and trainers, to provide real-time feedback from students in diverse ways. There are several types of licenses, and the free one allows the creation of two questions per event and up to 1000 participants, while the most comprehensive subscriptions do not have these limitations.

Some of the question types include:
- Multiple choice
- Poll
- Word cloud
- Open question
- Label an image
- Find on image
- Matching
- Brainstorming
- Filling the blanks
- Rating
- Find a number
- Sorting
- Prioritisation
- Script concordance test (SCT)
- SCT Judgment

All of these types of questions can be intertwined with slides (e.g., PowerPoint) or video (e.g., YouTube) during live presentations (synchronous). But they could also be implemented for offline activities (asynchronous).

Wooclap allows setting different parameters, such as: the duration of questions, how to share them, an indicator for students to click if they feel lost, or even the competition mode to show a podium with a score board.

## Additional details

- Subscription mode: Freemium
- Platform: Web
- Tested by: UAH (Elisa); UAH (imyelmo)
- Comments: Allow the generation of sets of questions to be posed to students interactively which can be integrated into Power Point and Google Slides.
