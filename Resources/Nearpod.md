Real-time insights into student understanding through interactive lessons, interactive videos, gamification, and activities — all in a single platform.


## Detailed description

Nearpod helps educators make any lesson interactive whether in the classroom or virtual. The concept is simple. A teacher can create interactive presentations that can contain Quiz’s, Polls, Videos, Collaborate Boards, and more. Thousands of pre-built K-12 standards-aligned lessons are accessible and teachers can also upload their existing lessons and make them interactive.

The students can access a teacher’s presentation through a code and the teacher then moves the class through the presentation and lets students interact with the media as they go. Teachers can also opt for Student-Paced mode, where the student controls the flow of the lesson. This mode is perfect for sub days, weather days, homework assignments, or independent work. The app is web-based and works on any device with an internet connection.
