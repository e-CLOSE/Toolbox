WISE is the product of more than 25 years of research on teaching and learning with educational technologies.


## Detailed description

In these challenging times, teachers are doing innovative work to ensure that their students have science learning opportunities and connect with their peers and teachers. They are connecting with colleagues to share ideas and resources and are adapting WISE units to meet the needs of their students.

The Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE) provides standards-aligned online inquiry science units. The WISE team now works directly with teachers to implement, customize, and create web-based distance learning curricula for their students. They are organizing weekly office hours, facilitating teacher collaboration on strategies for customizing WISE and creating their own instruction, and supporting students and families. WISE is free and available worldwide.
