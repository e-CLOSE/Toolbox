## Detailed description

Freeicons is a platform for designers and developers for a wide variety of high-quality icons of different styles, sizes with SVG, PNG, AI, EPS and PSD formats that could be used in all their personal and commercial projects. We're a successful team of designers and we provide products and services for free to those who canâ€™t afford to pay with money. In order to use an icon you must attribute it to its author, so we will be able to continue creating new graphic resources every day. Icon ownership can be transfered tailored to previous purchase.
