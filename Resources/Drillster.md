## Detailed description

Drillster is the interactive online learning program that works with an adaptive (self-learning) algorithm and is based on Leitner's scientific system. Drillster records what the individual user has already memorized, his correct and incorrect answers and the last time he has worked with a specific subject. These points determine the order and frequency of learning at the individual level. The result is that users learn more in less time and memorize information for longer.

Drillster is a new way of learning: technology, science, data, and, a smart algorithm wrapped up into one application. Drillster is question-based, adaptive, and predicts your future proficiency levels. Drillster makes learning 40% more efficient and 10% more effective! It stops important knowledge from declining. It helps you to develop, reinforce and retain knowledge and skills long-term, in a way thatâ€™s both fast and smart. Track, and check your knowledge levels year-round.
