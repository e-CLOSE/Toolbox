Royalty free music.


## Detailed description

Bensound is a website that offers free stock music tracks for use in various projects, such as animations, slideshows, background music for websites, web ads and much more. One particular aspect of this site is the quality of the music tracks it offers: at a quick count, we found 70 tracks on Bensound from various genres, neatly organized at the top of the site in tabs for quick navigation.

Bensound allows you to use the tracks for free in a variety of projects as long as you credit Bensound on the project. In addition, for a small fee, you can extend this license to a wider variety of production types, eliminating the requirement to credit Bensound. 

There are two ways to license music from Bensound: by paying an annual subscription, which is currently $129 with a $49 renewal fee, or by licensing tracks individually.
